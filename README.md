# Langdong 
## Towards solving Jigsaw Puzzles out of Historical Fragments

### Intro

Langdon, the most excellent puzzle solver of all time, is a jigsaw puzzle solver written in python and uses [lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai).
I developed the langdon project developed while studying computer science (M. Sc.) at [FAU](https://www.fau.eu).

The main contribution is the proposal of a deep siamese network architecture,
called Langdong , designed for historical fragment matching.

It is inspiered by the [work](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02367779/document) of [Pirrone](mailto:antoine.pirrone@labri.fr) et al.

### Get requirenments

You can use the environment.yml file and activate it.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -p /Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env &&
conda activate /Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env
```
*Note: If you want to use another package manger, you have to mangage it py your own. Sorry.*

### Run it on you own
#### EDA and Preproceccing
```bash
(/Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env): $jupyter notebook ./notebooks/eda_preproceccing.ipynb
```
#### Main
```bash
(/Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env): $python3 main.py
```
#### Training configuration
```bash
(/Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env): $vim ./config/config_local.toml
...
...
(/Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env): $vim./config/config_local.toml
```
#### Results 
```bash
(/Users/beantown/PycharmProjects/jigsaw-puzzle-solver/conda-env): $tensorboard --logdir ./results/default/version_X
```
*Note: You can change directory in config files. So, you must change it in the tensorboard command as well.*

#### Use custom steps

```python
from puzzle_solver.core import some_steps

def custom_init_step():
    ...
    return config, transform, model


def main():
    config, transform, model = custom_init_step()
    train_dataloader, val_dataloader = load_step(config, transform)
    tb_logger = log_step(config)
    train_step(config, model, train_dataloader, val_dataloader, tb_logger)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
*Note: step-functions must return the same as the original step-function. Not tested yet, sorry.*
